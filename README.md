<h1 align="center">Hi there!</a> 
<h3 align="center">A fairly simple password stiller from websites from the Google browser, written in Python. After you download the file, you need to go to the SGP file directory and run the file called StillerPassword.opy. Then, for a couple of seconds, a console window will appear, after which a file will appear just below output.txt . It will store all your passwords and usernames of the sites you visited. As well as a link to the site itself and the date of account creation.</h3>
